## How It Works
This game’s AI uses the Minimax algorithm, a classic decision-making process that simulates all possible moves to pick the best one. This ensures the AI either wins or forces a draw — no weak spots to exploit here. Pure, unbeatable strategy in action.



## How to Play
When the game starts, you’ll see an empty Tic Tac Toe board numbered like this:

 1 | 2 | 3
-----------
 4 | 5 | 6
-----------
 7 | 8 | 9
To make your move, type the number corresponding to the position where you want to place your mark (X or O).

The game alternates turns between players or between you and the AI.

The goal is to get three of your marks in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game automatically detects if someone wins or if it ends in a draw.

If playing against the AI, be prepared: it’s programmed to never lose!
