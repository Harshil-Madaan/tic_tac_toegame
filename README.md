# UnbeatableTicTacToe-Pygame

Welcome to **UnbeatableTicTacToe-Pygame** â€” a slick, interactive Tic Tac Toe game powered by Python and Pygame, featuring an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm. Play against a bot thatâ€™s literally impossible to beat (unless you settle for a draw). This is Tic Tac Toe, leveled up with graphics, sound, and smarts.

## Features

- **Unbeatable AI** powered by the Minimax algorithm  
- Graphical board rendered with Pygame (no more boring console!)  
- Two game modes: Player vs Player (PvP) and Player vs AI  
- Dynamic, clear win detection with animated winning lines  
- Easy controls: click to place your mark, keyboard shortcuts for quick actions  
- AI difficulty levels: from random moves to strategic perfection  
- Restart and mode-switching on the fly with keyboard keys

## How to Play

- Launch the game and watch the board appear.  
- Click on any empty square to place your mark (X or O).  
- Your goal: get three marks in a row â€” vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  
- The AI will respond with its move if you're playing against it.  
- Use these keyboard shortcuts to control the game:
  - `G` â€” Toggle between Player vs Player and Player vs AI modes  
  - `R` â€” Restart the game  
  - `0` â€” Set AI to random moves (easy mode)  
  - `1` â€” Set AI to unbeatable Minimax mode (hard mode)  
- Watch the winning line get drawn when someone wins, or settle for a draw.

## How It Works

- The game uses a **Board** class to track the game state and check wins.  
- The **AI** class implements the Minimax algorithm â€” it simulates every possible move recursively to pick the absolute best one.  
- The game runs on **Pygame**, rendering the grid, X's, and O's, and capturing mouse and keyboard inputs.  
- Minimax ensures the AI never loses; if you can beat it, youâ€™ve basically cracked the code.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x** â€” Core language for logic and game flow  
- **Pygame** â€” For rendering graphics and handling user input  
- **NumPy** â€” For efficient board state management  
- **Minimax Algorithm** â€” The unbeatable AI decision-making engine

## Installation & Running

1. Clone this repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Harshil-Madaan/UnbeatableTicTacToe-Pygame.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the folder:
    ```bash
    cd UnbeatableTicTacToe-Pygame
    ```
3. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then install Pygame and NumPy if you havenâ€™t yet:
